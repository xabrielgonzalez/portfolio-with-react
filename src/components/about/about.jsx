         <p className="myinfo">My name is Xabriel, and I have been interested in programming since my adolescence.
        I began my journey with my first language, which was <span className="abmc">C++</span>.
        Over time, I have acquired knowledge in<span className="abmnet"> .Net</span> and have had the opportunity to
        participate in various projects,
        such as the creation of ticket sales for shows and sporting
        events, which I have found immensely satisfying.

        Currently, I am deeply passionate about web development and the extensive possibilities it offers through the
        use of the latest technologies. I consider myself a self-taught individual, constantly exploring new
        technologies available in the market and integrating them into my projects to further enhance my skills and
        expertise.</p>
